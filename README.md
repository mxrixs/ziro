# Ziro

A slightly changed nord-themed version of the really nice [Ziro spicetify Theme](https://github.com/schnensch0/ziro) by schnensch0

The most signoficant changes are the following:
- Changes on certain colors for visibility:
  - scrollbars have a different color
  - Text on certain seleted elements have a different color
  - 'Unused' part of the timline has a different color
- Remove Podcast section from homepage. They can still be acessed via the sidebar and search. 

for any support please just go and use the original repository and the info that comes with it as this fork is only developed for the `nord` theme (in `colors.ini`) and for my specific setup.
